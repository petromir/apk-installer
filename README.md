# APK Installer

## Why
When dealing with multiple applications and various builds you often need to install `apk` files several times per day. Transfering `apk` files with Android File Transfer and later uninstalling the old application versions and installing the uploaded `apk` files might take a lot of time.

This tool helps you install `apk` files faster by just selecting the desired files and pressing `APK Installer` icon.

## Features
- Automatically gets the selected files within `Finder`.
- Automatically recognising the package from `apk` file, e.g. `com.example.myapp`, and uninstalling previously installed application from multiple Androind devices.
- Automatically installs the selected `apk` files to multiple connected Android devices.
- Notifies when the automatic uninstalling and installing completes.
